# BugRecon 

**BugRecon** is an automated bug-hunting tool designed to streamline the reconnaissance phase of bug bounty hunting and penetration testing. It automates essential tasks like subdomain enumeration, port scanning, directory brute-forcing, vulnerability scanning, and screenshot capturing. This allows security researchers to focus on deeper analysis and exploitation, increasing both efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Target Input**: Prompts the user to enter the target domain.
2. **Reconnaissance Depth**: Allows you to choose between shallow, medium, or deep scanning levels.
3. **Subdomain Enumeration**: Retrieves subdomains using crt.sh.
4. **Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports with `nmap`.
5. **Directory Brute-Forcing**: Discovers hidden directories using `ffuf`.
6. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detects common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
7. **Screenshot Capturing**: Captures screenshots of discovered web applications using `EyeWitness`.
8. **Report Generation**: Compiles all findings into a comprehensive, easy-to-read report.
9. **Modular Design**: Structured for easy expansion, allowing for the integration of additional features as needed.

## üìù Example (Coming Soon)

An example of BugRecon in action:

```bash
BugRecon Report for example.com

Subdomains Found:
- subdomain1.example.com
- subdomain2.example.com

Open Ports:
- 80
- 443

Vulnerabilities:
- subdomain1.example.com (Port 80)
  - Possible SQL Injection
  - Possible XSS
```

---

## üßæ Generated Report (example.com_report.txt)

A detailed report will be generated after the scan in the following format:

```
Bug Recon Report for example.com

Subdomains Found:
- subdomain1.example.com
- subdomain2.example.com

Open Ports:
- 80
- 443
- 8080

Vulnerabilities:
- subdomain1.example.com (Port 80)
  - Possible SQL Injection
  - Possible XSS
- subdomain3.example.com (Port 443)
